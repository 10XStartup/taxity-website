					LAWFUL BASIS FOR USING YOUR INFORMATION
				</h1>
				<p className="mb-6">
					In some cases, we will only use your personal information where we
					have your consent or because we need to use it in order to fulfil a
					contract with you (for example, because you have ordered services from
					us and we need to provide them).  However, there are other lawful
					reasons that allow us to process your personal information, including
					where we have a “legitimate interest”. This means that the reason that
					we are processing information is because there is a legitimate
					interest for Taxity to process your information.
				</p>

				<p className="mb-6">
					Whenever we process your personal data on the basis of a “legitimate
					interest”, we make sure that we take into account your rights and
					interests and will not process your personal information if we feel
					that there is a disproportionate privacy impact on you.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-6">
					We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we
					collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for
					another reason and that reason is compatible with the original
					purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing
					for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please
					contact us.  If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated
					purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which
					allows us to do so.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-6">
					Please note that we may process your personal data without your
					knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this
					is required or permitted by law
				</p>
			</div>
			<div className="bg-gray-100 p-8">
				<h1 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">DATA SECURITY AND ACCESS</h1>
				<p className="mb-6">
					We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your
					personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an
					unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access
					to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and
					other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only

					YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND CONTROLS

					and processing of your personal information is protected under the
					Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and

					been designed to uphold your rights where we act as a data
					processor/controller. Under certain circumstances, you have rights
					under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please
					go to the below headings to find out more about these rights: 
				</p>

				<ul className="list-disc ml-8 mb-6">
					<li>
						Request access to your personal data. This enables you to receive a
						copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are
						lawfully processing it.
					</li>
					<li>
						Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This
						enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about
						you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new
						data you provide to us.
					</li>
					<li>
						Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to
						delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us
						continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to
						delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully
						exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we
						may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are
						required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note,
						however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request
						of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you,
						if applicable, at the time of your request. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Object to processing of your personal data. Where we are relying on
						a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is
						something about your particular situation which makes you want to
						object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your
						fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object
						where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing
						purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling
						legitimate grounds to process your information which override your
						rights and freedoms.
					</li>
					<li>
						Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This
						enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal
						data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the
						data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you
						do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data
						even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish,
						exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use
						of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding
						legitimate grounds to use it. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third
						party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen,
						your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable
						format. Note that this right only applies to automated information
						which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used
						the information to perform a contract with you. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Withdraw consent at any time. Where we are relying on consent to
						process your personal data. However, this will not affect the
						lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your
						consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide
						certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at
						the time you withdraw your consent.
