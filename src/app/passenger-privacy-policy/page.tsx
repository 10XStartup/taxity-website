				<p>
					Welcome to Taxity! By using our platform, you agree to abide by the
					following Terms and Conditions. These Terms govern your use of our
					services, which connect passengers with drivers to provide efficient
					transportation solutions. Please read these Terms carefully before
					accessing or using our platform. By using Taxity, you also agree to

				<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Using the Taxity</h1>
				<p className="mb-6">
					Taxity provides transport information service by allowing passengers
					request transport services from drivers registered on Taxity.
					Transport services are provided by drivers under a contract (with you)
					for the carriage of passengers. Drivers provide transport services on
					an independent basis (either in person or via a company) as economic
					and professional service providers. Taxity is not responsible in any
					way for the fulfilment of the contract entered into between the
					passenger (you) and the driver. Disputes arising from consumer rights,
					legal obligations or from law applicable to the provision of transport
					services will be resolved between the passengers and drivers. Data
					regarding the drivers and their transport service is available in the
					Taxity app and receipts for journeys are sent on the app or sent to
					the email address listed in passenger’s profile upon request.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-6">
					The passenger (you) enters into a contract with the driver for the
					provision of transport services via the Taxity app with payment made
					through the Taxity in-app wallet system. Charges will be inclusive of
					applicable taxes where required by law. Charges may include other
					applicable fees, tolls, and/or surcharges including a booking fee,
					municipal tolls, airport surcharges or processing fees for split
					payments. If you wish, you may also choose to pay a Tip to the driver
					directly or via the use of Taxity in-App Payment. We may limit the
					maximum value of a Tip at our sole discretion.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-6">
					During the installation of Taxity app, passenger’s mobile number is
					linked to the respective Taxity user account and added to our
					database. If you are no longer using your mobile number, you must
					notify Taxity within 7 days so we can anonymize your account data. If
					you do not notify us about any change to your number, your mobile
					operator may issue the same mobile number to a new person who when
					using the Taxity app then may have access to your data.
				</p>

					payments by funding their wallet. With the provision of the Taxity
					in-App wallet Payment service, we act as commercial agent for the
					transport service providers. We are authorised by every driver as
					their commercial agent as intermediary for the conclusion of contracts
					between the driver and the passenger, including the power to accept
					payments from the passengers and to forward the payments to the
					driver. Your obligation to the driver will be fulfilled when the
					payment order is given to transfer funds to your Taxity wallet. All

					so. We will not hold a commission for the brokerage of the Tip and the
					Tip will be transferred to the driver in full amount, excluding any
					taxes, if applicable. We reserve the right to withhold the Tip, if the
					payment of the Tip is suspected as being fraudulent, illegal, for a
					purpose other than as a gratuity related to the service provided or
					used in conflict with Taxity’s Terms.

					For one-off passengers, you will be offered a ride option that allows
					you to agree to a fixed Fare for a given instance of Transportation
					service provided by the Driver (i.e Upfront Fare). Upfront Fare is
					communicated to you on our app before the ride is requested. Upfront
					Fare shall not be applied if you change the destination during the
					ride, the ride takes materially longer than estimated due to traffic
					or other factors, or when other unexpected circumstances impact the
					characteristics of the ride materially (e.g a route is used where
					tolls apply).

					Ordering and Cancelling Transport Services
				</h1>
				<p className="mb-6">
					When you order a transport service and the driver has agreed to
					undertake the work then the transport service is considered to be
					ordered.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-6">
					Once a driver confirms that he/she will complete your journey, you
					have entered into a separate agreement with the driver for the
					provision of the journey on such terms and conditions as you agree
					with the driver. We do not provide journeys or are a party to your
					agreement with the relevant driver.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-6">
					Cancellation of a transport service occurs when an order is placed,
					the driver has replied to your request and you subsequently reject,
					cancel or refuse the transport service. When a transport service
					request is cancelled after certain time period you are required to pay
					a cancellation fee.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-6">
					Cancelling a transport service request on multiple successive
					instances within 24-hour may lead us to temporarily block your account
					for warning. After multiple such warnings, we may suspend your account
					for long period (e.g 6 months). After the suspension period you could
					ask to reactivate your account and your application will be reviewed
					by our team.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-6">
					When you are notified of the driver’s arrival on our app and you fail
					to arrive within the free time allocated for the driver waiting, you
					will pay for additional waiting time according to specified rates or
					the driver may decide to cancel the journey. We are not responsible in
					any situation whereby the driver cancels a journey.

					You will be liable for any damage caused to the driver’s vehicle or
					its furnishing (among else, by blemishing or staining the vehicle or
					causing the vehicle to stink), the driver will have the right to
					require you to pay a penalty and/or require compensation for any
					damages exceeding the penalty. If you do not pay the penalty and/or

					provider of the transport service.
