					PROVISION OF TRANSPORTATION SERVICES
				</h2>
				<ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
					<li>
						You agree to provide Transportation Services in accordance with this
						Terms, Agreement as well as laws and regulations applicable in the
						state where you are providing Transportation Services. Please note
						that you are fully liable for any violation of any local laws and
						regulations as may arise from providing Transportation Services.
					</li>
					<li>
						You must have all licenses (including a valid driver’s license),
						permits, car insurance, liability insurance (if applicable),
						registrations, certifications and other documentation that are
						required in the applicable jurisdiction for providing the
						Transportation Services. It is your obligation to maintain the
						validity of all aforementioned documentation. Taxity reserves the
						right to require you to present evidence and submit for review all
						the necessary licenses, permits, approvals, authority, registrations
						and certifications.
					</li>
					<li>
						You are expected to provide the Transportation Services in a
						professional manner in accordance with the business ethics
						applicable to providing such services and endeavor to perform the
						Passenger's request in the best interest of the Passenger.
						Furthermore, you must consider the following:
						<ol className="list-decimal list-inside">
							<li>
								Take the route least costly for the Passenger, unless the
								Passenger explicitly requests otherwise;
							</li>
							<li>You may not make any unauthorized stops;</li>
							<li>
								You may not have any other passengers in the vehicle other than
								the Passenger and the passengers accompanying the Passenger;
							</li>
							<li>
								You must adhere to any applicable traffic acts and regulations,
								i.e must not conduct any actions that may disrupt driving or the
								perception of traffic conditions, including holding a phone in
								your hand while the vehicle is moving.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>

					<li>
						You have the sole right to determine when you are providing the
						Transportation Services. You shall accept, decline or ignore
						Transportation Services requests made by Passengers at your own
						choosing.
					</li>
					<li>
						You are obliged to provide and maintain all equipment and means that
						are necessary to perform the Transportation Services at your own
						expense, including a car, smartphone, etc. You are also responsible
						for paying all costs you incur in the course of performing the
						Transportation Services including, but not limited to, fuel, mobile
						data plan costs, duty fees, amortization of the vehicle, insurance,
						relevant corporate or payroll taxes etc. Please bear in mind that
						using the Taxity App may bring about consummation of large amount of
						data on your mobile data plan. Thus, we suggest you to subscribe for
						a data plan with unlimited or very high data usage capacity.
					</li>
					<li>
						You are entitled to charge a fare for each instance you have
						accepted a Passenger on the Taxity Platform and completed the
						Transportation Service as requested (i.e. Fare) for a one-off ride.
						The Fare is calculated based on a default base fare, the distance of
						the specific journey as determined by the GPS-based device and the
						duration of the specific travel. The default base fare may fluctuate
						based on the local market situation. In markets with In-app payment,
						you may negotiate the Fare by sending us a pertinent request that
						has been either signed digitally or by hand. Additionally, you shall
						always have the right to charge the Passenger less than the Fare
						indicated by the Taxity App. However, charging the Passenger less
						than the Taxity App indicates, does not decrease the Taxity Fee.
					</li>
					<li>
						Upon a request for a one- off ride by a Passenger, a fixed fare (i.e
						Upfront Fare) is given for Transportation Service provided by you.
						Upfront Fare is communicated via the App to a Passenger before the
						ride is requested, and to you when the ride is accepted or at the
						end of the ride. The Fare calculated in accordance the with the
						distance of the journey shall be applied instead of Upfront Fare if
						the Passenger changes the destination during the ride, the ride
						takes materially longer than estimated due to traffic or other
						factors, or when other unexpected circumstances impact the
						characteristics of the ride materially (e.g a route is used where
						tolls apply).
					</li>
					<li>
						With regards to the In App wallet payment, in any instance you find
						out that there has been an error in the calculation of the Fare and
						wish to make corrections in the calculation of the Fare, you must
						submit a petition in the section “Fare Review “of the App. If a
						petition in the section Fare Review of the App has not been
						submitted, then we shall not recalculate the Fare or reimburse you
						for an error made in the calculation of the Fare.
					</li>
					<li>
						We may adjust the Fare for a particular ride completed, if we detect
						a violation (such as taking a longer route or not stopping the fare
						meter of our App after the Transportation Services have been
						completed) or in case a technical error affecting the final fare is
						identified. We may also reduce or cancel the fare in case we have
						reasonable cause to suspect a fraud or a complaint by the Passenger
						indicates a violation by you. We will only exercise its right to
						reduce or cancel the fare in a reasonable and justified manner.
					</li>
					<li>
						Passengers may be given the option to tip you after a successful
						provision of Transportation Services. The Passenger can Tip you only
						by using thein app wallet. The Tip will not affect the amount of our
						Fees and we will not collect a commission on the Tip paid by the
						Passenger. You are obliged to fully comply with any tax obligations
						arising from the Tipping. We may limit the maximum value of a Tip at
						our sole discretion.
					</li>
					<li>
						After each successful provision of Transportation Services, Taxity
						shall create and forward a receipt to the Passenger consisting of
						some or all of the following information: the company’s business
						name, place of business, the first name and surname of the Driver, a
						photo of the Driver, service license number (if applicable), the
						registration number of the vehicle, the date-, the time-, the start
						and end locations-, the duration and length-, the Fare and the Fare
						and Tip paid for the provision of the Transportation Services. The
						receipt of each provision of Transportation Services is available to
						you via the Taxity Driver Account.
					</li>
					<li>
						While in the course of the provision of the Transportation Services,
						a Passenger or its co-passengers negligently damage the vehicle or
						its furnishing (among else, by blemishing or staining the vehicle or
						causing the vehicle to stink), you shall have the right to request
						the Passenger to pay a penalty and/or request compensation for any
						damages exceeding the penalty. If the Passenger does not consent to
						paying the penalty and/or compensating the damage, you must notify
						us and we will then try to collect penalty and/or relevant costs on
						your behalf from the Passenger. However, bear in mind that we are
						not taking any liability for direct or indirect damages in relation
						to cleaning or maintenance of the vehicle caused by Passenger.
					</li>
					<li>
						You hereby acknowledge that you are obliged to fully comply with all
						tax obligations that arise to you from the applicable laws in
						relation to providing the Transportation Services, including (i)
						paying income tax, social security tax or any other tax applicable;
						and (ii) fulfilling all employee and tax registration obligations
						for calculations in regard to accounting and transfers to applicable
						State authorities as required by the applicable law. In case the Tax
						authority will submit a valid application to us to provide
						information regarding the activities of you, we may make available
						to the Tax authority the information regarding the activities of you
						to the extent set forth in valid legal acts. Additionally, it is
						your obligation to adhere to all applicable tax regulations that may
						apply in connection with the provision of Transportation Services.
						You hereby agree to compensate Taxity all state fees, claims,
						payments, fines or other tax obligations that Taxity will incur in
						connection with the obligations arising from applicable tax
						regulations not having been met by you (including paying the income
						tax and social tax).

					<p className="mb-4">
						To use the Taxity Services, you are obliged to pay a fee (i.e. the
						Taxity Fee). The Taxity Fee is paid based on the Fare of each
						Transportation Service order that you have completed on one-off

				<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">IN-APP WALLET PAYMENTS</h2>
				<p className="mb-4">
					We have created an in-built wallet to enable passengers to pay for the
					Transportation Service directly. You hereby authorize us as your
					commercial agent to receive the Fares or other fees paid by the
					Passenger via In-app wallet Payment and to forward relevant funds to
					you. Any payment obligation made by the Passenger via the In-app
					Payment shall be considered fulfilled as of the time that the payment
					has been made.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					You may not refuse payment by the Passenger via the In-app wallet
					Payment, or influence the Passenger against the use of the In-app
					wallet Payment for one-off rides. In case you refuse to accept an
					In-app Payment without just cause, we shall be entitled to charge you
					a contractual penalty in the amount determined by the actual fare of
					the journey for every refusal and/or block your right to use the
					Taxity Services in case of repetitive behavior.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					If the option is available and the Passenger chooses to Tip you
					directly in our App, the Tip will be collected on your behalf together
					with the Fares and other fees paid by the Passenger via the In-app
					wallet Payment. If the payment of the Tip is suspected as being
					fraudulent, illegal, for a purpose other than as a gratuity related to
					the service provided, or used by a Driver in conflict with our Terms
					and Conditions, then we can withhold the Tip.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					You are entitled to review In-app wallet Payment reports in the Taxity
					Driver Account or App. The reports will show the amounts in the In-app
					wallet brokered in the previous week as well as the withheld amounts
					of the Taxity Fee. You must notify us of any important circumstances
					which may affect our obligations to collect and distribute the Fares
					paid via In-app wallet Payment.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					Before providing Transportation Services, you must verify that the
					service is being actually provided to the right Passenger or the
					Passenger has expressly confirmed he/she allows other passengers to
					ride under the Passenger’s account.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					Do note that we may or may not set off any Fares or Tip paid via
					In-app wallet Payment against the amounts that you are obliged to pay
					to us (i.e. Taxity Fees and contractual penalties). If we are not able
					to pay the Fees or Tip to you due to you not including your bank
					account details in your Driver´s account or if the bank account
					details have been noted incorrectly, then we will hold such payments
					for 180 days. If you do not notify us of the correct bank account
					details within 180 days from the date that the right to claim such
					payments has been established, your claim regarding the payment of the
					Fare or Tip not transferred to you shall expire.

				<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">CUSTOMER SUPPORT</h2>
				<p className="mb-4">
					We provide Drivers with customer support regarding the use of our
					Services. We have the right to stop providing customer support
					services in case you are in delay with any of the payments for more
					than 5 (five) calendar days.

			<div className="container mx-auto px-4 py-6">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">RATINGS AND ACTIVITY</h2>
				<p className="mb-4">
					To provide high-quality service, you hereby acknowledge that the
					Passengers may provide you a rating and leave feedback regarding the
					quality of the Transportation Services that you have provided. Your
					average rating will be linked to your Driver´s account and will be
					available to Passengers on the Taxity App. If we find out the rating
					or comment is not given in good faith, this rating or comment may not
					be projected in the calculations of your rating.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					We shall measure your level of activity and provide you with an
					activity score, which is based on your activity regarding accepting,
					declining, not responding, and completing Transportation Service
					requests.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					To provide reliable services to Passengers, we may determine a minimum
					average rating and a minimum activity score that Drivers must
					establish and maintain. If, after a pertinent notification from us,
					you do not increase your average rating or activity score to the
					minimum level within the prescribed time period, your Driver´s account
					will be automatically suspended either temporarily or permanently. We
					may reverse the suspension of your account if it is merited by any
					external circumstances or it is detected that the suspension was
					caused by a system error or false ratings.

					MARKET OVERVIEWS AND CAMPAIGNS
				</h2>
				<p className="mb-4">
					We may send you, via the Taxity App, Taxity Driver Account, SMS,
					e-mail, or other means, market overviews, in order to increase your
					awareness regarding when the demand by the Passengers is highest. Such
					market overviews are merely recommendatory and do not constitute any
					obligations for you. As the market overview estimations are based on
					previous statistics, we cannot give any guarantees that the actual
					market situation will correspond to the estimations provided in the
					market overview.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					We may also provide campaigns, whereby we will guarantee a minimum
					income if you provide Transportation Services within a specified
					timeframe. If the specified minimum is not reached by you, we shall
					compensate the gap. The specific requirements and conditions will be
					sent via the Taxity App, Taxity Driver Account, SMS, e-mail, or other
					means. We have full discretion in deciding if, when, and to which
					Drivers we provide such campaigns. If we have reasonable cause to
					suspect any fraudulent activity by you, we may withhold your Fare
					until the suspicion of fraud has been cleared.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					We may also occasionally arrange various campaigns to Passengers in
					order to promote the Taxity Platform. If the Fare paid by the
					Passengers is reduced as part of such a campaign, we shall pay you
					compensation, amounting to the monetary value of the benefit offered
					to the Passengers. We may set off the marketing compensation against
					the Taxity Fee.

					our best to notify you if any substantial amendments are made to the
					Terms that we consider likely to materially affect your rights and
					obligations. Any such notice will be posted on the Platform, or sent
					to the email address associated with your Taxity Account. Please note
					that Taxity may not inform you of any immediate amendment required to
					address an unforeseen and imminent danger related to health, safety,
					or cybersecurity risks, or defending the Taxity Services, Passengers,
					or Drivers from fraud, malware, spam, or data breaches. By continuing
					to use the Taxity platform after we have posted the revised Terms, you

					If you do not agree to the amendments of the Terms or other conditions
					of the Agreement, you have the right to terminate the Agreement by

					notice to Taxity. The termination of the Agreement takes effect on the
					effective date of the proposed amendment, unless otherwise provided in
					your termination notice. Your use of the Taxity Services on or after
					the effective date of the amendment constitutes your consent to be
					bound by the General Terms or Agreement, as amended.
